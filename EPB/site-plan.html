        We have two battelfields to play on. we have speedball which is our fast pace
        no surrender policy course, and the we have Verdun which is a more rural layout. Verdun is a more family friendly 
        layout that is gives you the real battlefield experience. On the battelefield of Verdun, 
        you will encounter a thick and woodsy enviroment. Bring some shoes and clothes that you don't mind getting dirty because
        there will be a little bit of mud along with a creek that runs through the center of the battlefield. 
        There are two different games to play on both of these maps. You can either play classic team death match
        or capture the flag.

        In TDM the rules are simple:
        once you are hit you are out of the match
        getting shot in the gun does not mean you are out
        If you are out of ammo you are out, unless you can be resupplied via teammates 

        In Capture the flag the rules are a little different:
        There are respawns, which means if you are hit, you have to go to your teams respawn zone to respawn 
        If you are hit while holding the flag of the other team, you must drop it immediatley
        The flag can't be thrown
        your team can return your flag if it is stolen and dropped

      <p>
        Verdun map layout and enviroment:
        Woodsy 
        creek runs through middle of battlefield

        More for casual play
        may encounter some mud
        lots of natural cover (trees, bushes, logs)
        Barricades, barrells, and two two-story forts (one for each team)
        great for capture the flag 

        Speedball map layout and enviroment:
        open field with blow up barricades 
        fast pace
